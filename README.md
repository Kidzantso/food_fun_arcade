## 📅 Development Log

### 🗓️ Day 1 – Catch the Food 

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Set up the Flutter project structure.  
- ✅ Created the **main app structure** with total points tracking.  
- ✅ Built the **Home Screen** (entry point with navigation to mini-games).  
- ✅ Developed the **Catch the Food** game screen:
  - Implemented falling food items (burger, fries, drink).  
  - Created a movable basket controlled by drag gestures.  
  - Added **collision detection** for catching food.  
  - Designed **McDonald’s-style UI** (red, yellow, white theme).  
  - Implemented **timer and scoring system**.  
  - Ensured score never goes negative.  
  - Added **end-game popup** with score summary and a “Home” button.  
- 🧠 Prepared app for adding multiple mini-games in the future.

### 🗓️ Day 2 – Memory Match Game

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ Created the **Memory Match** game screen with full gameplay logic:
  - Implemented randomized food emoji pairs.  
  - Added card flipping animation and matching logic.  
  - Added **score and timer system** similar to Catch Food.   
- ✅ Designed the UI to **match the Catch Food screen’s visuals**, including:
  - Red background and yellow-themed cards.  
  - Matching fonts, layout, and McDonald’s-style color scheme.  
  - Consistent score/time bar at the top.  
- ✅ Recreated the **end-game popup dialog**:

### 🗓️ Day 3 – Drink Tapper Game & UI Enhancements

**Tasks Completed:**

- ✅ **Replaced “Build the Burger”** with a new, more engaging and easier-to-play game: **Drink Tapper**.  
- ✅ Created the **Drink Tapper Screen**:
  - Drinks appear randomly on the screen and disappear after a short time.  
  - Players must **tap the drinks quickly** to earn points.  
  - The speed dynamically increases as the score rises.  
  - Ensured balance so the game becomes fast but not impossible.  
- ✅ Implemented **the same visual design** as the previous games:
  - Consistent McDonald’s-style UI (red, yellow, and white theme).  
  - Rounded yellow pop-up at the end with “Back to Home” button.  
- ✅ Integrated with **shared point system**:
  - Each game reports earned points back to the `HomeScreen`.  
  - Total score is updated seamlessly.  
- 🧠 Improved **gameplay feel and difficulty curve** to keep it fun and responsive.
